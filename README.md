### Connecting web to Ethereum Test Network (Ropsten)

 - Firstly we made a smart contract on Remix ide using ***SOLIDITY*** .
 - Then we deployed our contract on ***Ropsten*** Test Netwoek to test our code.
 - After it we make a user interface using *HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT* .
 - Now the time come where ***Web3*** plays its role, Web3 connect our web app to the ropsten test network through infura client (using endpoints).
 - As development is incomplete without the version control system(VCS) ,here we use ***GIT*** and ***GITHUB*** for version controlling .    
   Link of the remote repository is as follow : [Remote Repo](https://github.com/haseeebmalik/New-folder-3-)
