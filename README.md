### Connecting web to Ethereum Test Network (Ropsten)

- We make a user interface using *HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT* .
 - Now the time come where ***Web3*** plays its role, Web3 connect our web app to the ropsten test network through infura client (using endpoints).
 - As development is incomplete without the version control system(VCS) ,here we use ***GIT*** and ***GITHUB*** for version controlling .    
   
   
 ### Important :
 
  - *Here we are not making any change in blockchain i.e we are not making any transaction .*
  - *We are just reading the data from blockchain .*
  - *Hence it will cost no gas : )  .*
